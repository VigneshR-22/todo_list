# todo_list
This is a To-Do List application

The technologies that are used in this application are as follows:
1. Java
2. Spring Boot
3. Thymeleaf
4. HTML, CSS

To view the UI of this to-do list application, run the application and move to:
http://localhost:8080/tasks

Here you can view your existing to-do list on the landing page. (Since I am using h2 database, the landing page will be empty as it is an in-memory database)
